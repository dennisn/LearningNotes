    + Sub-optimal planning & execution of transport paths --> outdated method, no real-time considerations, etc.
    + Inventory mis-management: poor forecasting + no real-time visibility --> over/under-stocking, poor lifecycle management --> obsolete/slow-moving stock tying up capital

### Building & Deploying AI Agents
  - Some frameworkds: AutoGen (Microsoft), OpenAI SDK (OpenAI), LangChain
  - AI models: 
    + Closed source (e.g. OpenAI): models are used through API --> only need internet connection
    + Open source: GPU machine is needed to host the model
