## 2. Intro. to OO Design
  - Four Pillars:
    + Abstraction: Implementation Hiding
    + Encapsulation: Data hiding
    + Inheritance: object classification
    + Polymorphism: objects interchange-ability
  - SOLID principles:
    + Single responsibility: well-defined responsibility/job
    + Open-Closed: extensions point for customization
    + Liskov substitution: interchange-ability
    + Interface segregation/separation: divide task specific interfaces
    + Dependency Inversion: not tie yourself to specific implementation
  - Cohesion: how closely related the code in any grouping focused on a single concept 
    + Better to have many small, but highly-cohesive class than one large class
  - Coupling: how much one class/object is dependent on another
    + Tight coupling is more brittle: change in one class often required change(s) in other
    + Tight coupling is ok when there shouldn't be multiple implementations of a class. If there are, then it should be dependent on the interface only to make it flexible

## 3. The Four Pillars
  - Abstraction: hiding the implementation --> minimize visibility
    + Visibility == Contract: unable to change in the future
  - Encapsulation: keep data close to its use, while minimize visibility
  - Inheritance: extract commonalities to base class, while leaving type-specific code in subtype
    + Base class should not know about descendants existence
  - Polymophism: object can have multiple capabilities/roles (i.e. interfaces)

## 4. The SOLID principles
  - In depth study: "SOLID Principles for C# Developers" by Stve Smith
  - Single responsibility: a module should have a clearly-defined job
    + related to Abstraction & Encapsulation
    + Example: A car state only change for make, model, running status (e.g. car-related concepts), not for "lower-level" concepts like brake, throttle, engine
  - Open/Close principle: should be able to extend a class behavior without modifying it --> 
    + With inheritance: where each implementation variation should not impact existing one
    + With composition: new component can be added without changing the "owner" code
    + Design tips: separate "bedrock" code into base classes, while specializations on top of that bedrock into subclasses
      - If class has multiple "modes", switching its behavior --> signs to break them into smaller classes
  - Liskov substitution principle --> Polymorphism
    + Not only inter-change, but also ensure the substitution "**work/behave**" inter-change-able
  - Interface Segregation Principle: make fine-grained interfaces that are task-specific
    + Interface: group related functionality together --> keep interfaces cohesive
  - Dependency Inversion Principle: depend on abstractions, not on concretions
    + Class: should not building dependency themselves --> either set via constructor or properties

## 5. Intro. to Design Patterns
  - Design patterns describes a wellâ€‘known solution to a specific problem
    + "C# Design Patterns" by Kevin Dockx
  - Singleton: beware of thread safety: multiple threads trying to create the "singleton"  object at the same time
  - Builder: centralizes the knowledge of how to build the objects into a single place in your code
  - Strategy: choose one best strategy among multiple strategies
  - Avoid Pattern Fever: looking for excuses to use a pattern
    + Patterns are meant to help Devs not re-inventing the wheel only

## 6. Nullability
  - Nullability --> communicate intent about null-able from library to user code 
  - Override null-checking --> while transitioning old project only
  - Still need runtime checking of null value, but now compiler will help you catch more cases at compile time

## 7. Equality, Immutability, and Record Types
  - Immutability: object can't be modified after creation
    + Pro: thread safe, validated once (at construction)
    + Often used to "**communicate intent**": create temp. class with members that are set at init only
  - Equality: value vs. reference equality
    + Often need hash code implementation: `HashCode.Combine(member1, member2, etc);`
    + **Tips**: Don't partially implement IEquatable --> Equals(T); Equals(object); operator == and !=; GethashCode() 
  - Records: implement value equality & immutability by default
    + All members are part of the constructor, but no null checking --> need `required` keywords to mark it as required
    + Could define the record long-hand with property members `init` only --> need to implement `Equals(T)` & `GetHashCode()`
    + Other ability: PrimtMembers(), Deconstruction()
    + We can make a new copy of a record and only mention the differences from the original using the `with` keyword
      ```
      var normalized = NormalizeAddress(mailingInfo) with
      {
        FullName = mailingInfo.FullName.ToUpper(),
      };
      ```
  - Record Structs: value types vs Record: reference type ==> best suited as a light weight PropertyBag to pass between methods
    + Can't be inherited
    + Not a reference, or no reference equality needed
    + is not "**immutable**", unless it's declared as `readonly`
    + can use initializer syntax for the whole thing
    + **Tips**: Favor record structs for DTOs or parameter objects

## 8. OO Examples: Options Pattern
  - Define a settings class, with members matching settings expected in a section, then retrieve it from configuration
    + Pros: can add behavior like default value
    ```
    var configuration = new ConfigurationBuilder()
          .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", false, true)
          .Build();
  
    var sampleSettings = configuration.GetSection(SampleSettings.SectionName).Get<SampleSettings>();
    ```
  - With IoC, we can add option, set it to bind to specific section, and also trigger validation of the settings with annotations
    ```
    var serviceCollection = new ServiceCollection().AddTransient<XXX, YYY>();
    serviceCollection
        .AddOptions<SampleSettings>()
        .Bind(configuration.GetSection(SampleSettings.SectionName))
        .ValidateDataAnnotations()
        .ValidateOnStart()
    ```
  - For full dependency injection on CLI with upfront validation:
    ```
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
      await Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
          .ConfigureAppConfiguration( configBuilder =>
          {
              configBuilder.AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", false, true).Build();
          })
          .ConfigureServices((context, serviceCollection) => 
          {
              serviceCollection
                .AddOptions<SampleSettings>()
                .Bind(configuration.GetSection(SampleSettings.SectionName))
                .ValidateDataAnnotations()
                .ValidateOnStart();
              serviceCollection.AddTransient<ISettingsLogger, SettingsLogger>();
              serviceCollection.AddHostedService<ProgramService>();
          })
          .RunConsoleAsync();
    }

    class ProgramService : IHostedService 
    {
      ...
      public Task StartAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken) { ... }
      public Task StopAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken) { ... }
    }
    ```
  - Different IOptionXX interface:
    + IOptions<T>: return the option at started time
    + IOptionsSnapshot<T>: return the option snapshot at request time (more fore ASP.Net)
    + IOptionsMonitor<T>: raises events when the settings file changes
