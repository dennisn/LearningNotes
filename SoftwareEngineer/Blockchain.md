# Blockchain Fundamentals

## Concept
  - Using cryptography & distributed network to ensure transparent & tamper-free transactions ==> ensure trust between parties participate in transactions
  
### Acquired blockchain
  - Mining: not so feasible now
  - Buying through unregulated market: may unwittingly participate in money laundering
  - Buying through an exchange: need sign up and verifying identity
    + Need care of picking the exchange, as your private info. has to be provided
### Usages:
  - Internet of things: secure transaction between devices
  - Product lifecycle: attached information about the product throughout its lifecycle
  - Certification: issue certifications in tamper-free manner
  - Secure information sharing: similar to certification, but can also used for sharing of sensitive info. such as health information
  - Virtual products: use blockchain to control access to digital products
  - NFT: Non-fungible token: 
  
When "**NOT**" to use Blockchain
  - When data is shared in a closed-system between known & trusted parties --> add no value, but overhead
