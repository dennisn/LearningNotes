# Emergent trends
  - Three main trend: 
    + Big Data and Real-Time Analytics: let user monitor trends (sales, markets, etc) in real time and quickly respond to demands
    + Cloud-based migration: optimise operation, increase integration while reduce upfront cost, but still have access to latest tools
    + Apply AI: assist in analysis/decision making, using natural language

## Trends in areas
  - Forecast: Besides using AI to improve accuracy, the forecast process can also be automated, and collaborate with partners (i.e. production + retails) to share each other forecast --> improve forecast accuracy
  - Distribution
    + Smart warehousing + robotics
    + Last-mile delivery optimization + drones
  - Technical tools for Supply Chain Management
    + Cloud-based + real-time data sharing --> improve efficiency
    + IoT --> real-time tracking
  - Sustainability
    + Green logistics practices to reduce environment impact
    + Blockchain to ensure transparency
  - Planning:
    + Resource forecasting & allocation using advanced software
    + Data-driven: BI dashboards & tools for real-time insights --> identify patterns for planning
    + Scenario planning for risk management with scenario modeling software
  - Demand
    + Analyse real-time data, AI-powered sentiment analysis for demand forecast
    + Personalization & Omni-channel management to improve demand forecasting across multiple sales channels
  - Big data
    + Data lake & meta data: put raw data from different sources together in one repository --> analysis can combine them to spot trends
    + Real-time streaming + Complex Event Processing (aka CEP) --> react to events quickly
    + Data virtualisation + federated querying: present the combined data from different source as one + query data across various sources --> comprehensive insights & faster data retrieval
  - AI
    + Autonomous task: such as self-driving vehicles, drones
    + Predictive maintenance --> reduce down time
    + Manage risk, from weather to market/political, and provide warnings + mitigation strategies
    + Demand forecast/sensing --> optimise inventory level
    + Optimise operation, such as route optimization, warehouse layout
