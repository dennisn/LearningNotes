# Collections And Generic

  - Reason: some algorithms/concepts, such as "sort", or "collection", can be applied to more than one types
    + For statistical-typed language, object type needs to be declared at compile time (for verification ?)
	+ Generic comes in to allow re-used of above agorithms: implementations against a yet-unknown type T with specified constraints
