# Hello World: How to be human in the age of the machine

## Power

Discuss the power balance between entrusting too much, or too little to the machine

  - AI, or algorith, is designed set of instructions --> hence it has strength & weakness, as decided by its designer
    - strength often be the ability to handle complexity
    - weakness could be inherent bias by the available data, or by its creator him/herself
  - People have a tendency to **overlook** the capability of **machine making mistake** !
    - *Is a program really smart, or just an excel sheet wrapped in code?*
  - Yet once an error is found, we become distrust of the machine capability, to our loss
