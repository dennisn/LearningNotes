# Data

## Blockchain
  - Start of from a whitepaper for crypto-currency
  - Now mainstream use is for creating distributed ledgers

### Distributed ledgers
  - Block of data, chain together in **fixed ordered**.
  - Each block of data use hash to ensure data integrity: not prevent tampering but ensure any changes will make that block, or its data record, invalid
  - Ledger is distributed, and achieve the source of truth via concensus --> prevent both malicious or unintentional corruption, and allow recovery from such events

==> **USAGE**: distributed database, for example: sharing information between players in supply chain management, providers in healthcare

### Smart contract
  - A further use of distributed ledgers
  - Instead of "block of data", we have "block of contract", where contract define the action to be taken when certain conditions are met: date time, stock price, a transaction completed, etc.
  - Platforms are built to allow these smart contracts to be built & use by users
