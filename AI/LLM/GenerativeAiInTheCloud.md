# Generative AI in the Cloud 
From Linkedin learning
  - AI wasn't a new tech, but resource intensive
  - Cloud-computing & Saas --> make using Generative AI possible via economic of scales

## 1. Cloud-Based services for Generative AI
  - Storage: central to all AI system
    + Structure storage for ease of access
    + Quality of data: garbage in, garbage out
  - Cloud service --> better scalability
  - NLP: provide a bridge on how we communicate as human --> computer to understand us
  - API for GenAI: simplify the access, especially for 3rd party software
  - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): 2 components: 1 to generate new data and 1 to evaluate the realistics of the generated ata
    + Often used in generating images & videos

## 2. Features of Cloud-Based Generative AI
  - Some usages for text data: language translation, generate content, chatbots & virtual assistants, etc.
  - NLP models: 
    + Rule-based (i.e. predefined grammatical rules)
    + Template-based (e.g. customer support message)
    + Statistical language models: use probabilities of word sequences
    + Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): deep learning model to determine the probability of word combinations
    + Transformer model: Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)
  - RNN models: suitable for those of sequence in nature (e.g. music generation)
    + Usage: music for advertising, entertainment, stimulus growth in plants
    + Need huge datasets of music --> transform into suitable format for training
    + Still need inputs from human
    + The output must be processed further --> audio file
