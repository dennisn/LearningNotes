## Concepts

## Basic ReAct Agent

  - ReAct: "Reason-and-Act" --> enhanced explain-ability
    + Using a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand and reason the user request, then act upon it
    + Uses a cycle where the LLM analyzes the input (thought), executes actions (action), and validates results (observation). This cycle repeats until satisfactory results are achieved
