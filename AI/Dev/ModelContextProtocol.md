# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## MCP server introduction
  - From https://www.linkedin.com/learning/unboxing-ai-build-a-remote-mcp-server-from-zero-to-deployed-with-oauth
  - MCP: Protocol to provide context to model (i.e. AI Engine)
    + can tell client (i.e. AI Engine) what is available, and how to get it
    + Services: 
      - Tools: actions that the server can perform on behalf of the AI (i.e. custom functions)
      - Resources: information, data that the server can provide (i.e. data retrieval)
      - Prompts: extra instruction from MCP server to AI engine (i.e. prompt templates)
      - Future: Inter-server processing: can tell AI engine to get more data from somewhere else, combine with the server returned data, do more transformation, etc., before return to user
  - MCP is an open protocol (e.g. similar to HTTP)
    + Anyone can create MCP server, but quality & safety will be different per server (e.g. bad content)

## MCP Security concerns
  - Vibe coding: Good for prototype, but better start off from scratch for production
    + Many concerns may be overlooked, especially security
  - Excessive permissions: MCP is between LLM & API --> resfrain from expose API through MCP, especially "destructive" abilities
    + LLM is not human equivalent: may mis-understand instruction, or intention
  - Agent Error: LLM model, while working, may ends up in error/dead-end, so will discard those errors. However, MCP server provide "actuator" for LLM agent --> the errors will result in impacts in real-life
  - Promp injection: current integration of MCP server --> put prompt from MCP server to LLM agent ==> theoretically, MCP server may include "prompts" that lead the agent astray !
  - Confused deputy (man-in-the-middle attack ?): best practice to use official systems, as they have built in mechanism to try to avoid this
    + Session hi-jacking - malicious MPC server can give authorization session to others
