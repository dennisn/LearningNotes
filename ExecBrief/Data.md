# Data

## Blockchain
  - Start of from a whitepaper for crypto-currency
  - Now mainstream use is for creating distributed ledgers

### Distributed ledgers
  - Block of data, chain together in **fixed ordered**.
  - Each block of data use hash to ensure data integrity: not prevent tampering but ensure any changes will make that block, or its data record, invalid
  - Ledger is distributed, and achieve the source of truth via concensus --> prevent both malicious or unintentional corruption, and allow recovery from such events

==> **USAGE**: distributed database, for example: sharing information between players in supply chain management, providers in healthcare

### Smart contract
  - A further use of distributed ledgers
  - Instead of "block of data", we have "block of contract", where contract define the action to be taken when certain conditions are met: date time, stock price, a transaction completed, etc.
  - Platforms are built to allow these smart contracts to be built & use by users
  
## Quantum computing
  - bits vs. qubits: instead of represent 1/0, now represent 1/0/superstate
    - super-state: between state where there are possibility of 0 or 1, but not yet decided
  - Should be good at solving certain hard problem for classical computing: some of intractable problems
  - Intractable problems: problems we know how to solve, but required resources/time make it impractical
    - factor large number in breaking encryption
	- "traveling saleman problem" in optimisation
  - Quantum interference and entanglement: properties of quantum physics that help with solving problems
    - interference: reinforce or cancel each other out
	- entanglement: states of multiple qubits are linked
  - Some practical impacts: 
    - Research on how to use quantum computer for encryption
	- Research on how to use classical computer for encryption that can't be craced by quantum computer
  - Still some time to comes when quantum computer can actually be used in problems that they are best for, **alongside** classical computer
