# Hello World: How to be human in the age of the machine

## Power

Discuss the power balance between entrusting too much, or too little to the machine --> know what to trust/delegate and what not

  - People have a tendency to **overlook** the capability of **machine making mistake** !
    - *Is a program really smart, or just an excel sheet wrapped in code?*
  - Yet once an error is found, we become distrust of the machine capability, even though it is better than us in many **right** situations
  - AI, or algorith, is designed set of instructions --> hence it has strength & weakness, as decided by its designer
    - strength often be the ability to handle complexity, massive calculation with high accuracy
    - weakness could be inherent bias by the available data, or by its creator

## Data
  - The internet age --> massive personal data available (even after anonymise, which is really hard)
  - Data help predict trends: **improve service quality**, but also allow for **manipulation**, **discrimination**
    - Law is still playing catch up with reality
    
## Justice
  - Human judge can't make consistent judgement: probably because of subjective, mood, environmental factors, etc.
    - Machine is more consistent
  - Machine can fall into mathematical bias: same accuracy rate may result in more cases of false positive
    - Example: 75% accuracy in population of 100 and 200, will result in 25 and 50 cases of false positve
  - Propose: maybe a system to combined human + machine, such that each strength complement each other weakness, for a target goal
