# Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence

## Machine Learning
  - Traditional computer program: good at discrete result (e.g. yes/no, good/bad, etc.)
  - Machine learning: widen computer ability to predict the probability of some result in the future !
  - ML definition: 
    - Learn from existing sample data 
    - To build a model that can be used to predict future result base on actual data at that time
  - ML algorithms: mutliple algorithms hosted on ML platform, each with its own pros & cons and suitability
    - Which model to use: decided by the data scientists through an iterative process
    - Result: the probability of some result, a number, but no explanation (i.e. "**Blackbox of ML**")
  - ML algorithm types:
    - Supervised learning: 
      - Classification: binary-classification vs. multi-class classification
        - Example binary: Spam or no spam email.
        - Example multi-class: Animal types
      - Regression: result is a single value 
        - Example: expected house price
    - Un-supervised learning: don't provide the same level of direction/intention as above
	  - Clustering: understand the structure of the data by grouping them together
	  - Abnormally detection
