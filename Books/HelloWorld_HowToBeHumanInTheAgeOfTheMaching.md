# Hello World: How to be human in the age of the machine

## Power

Discuss the power balance between entrusting too much, or too little to the machine --> know what to trust/delegate and what not

  - People have a tendency to **overlook** the capability of **machine making mistake** !
    - *Is a program really smart, or just an excel sheet wrapped in code?*
  - Yet once an error is found, we become distrust of the machine capability, even though it is better than us in many **right** situations
  - AI, or algorith, is designed set of instructions --> hence it has strength & weakness, as decided by its designer
    - strength often be the ability to handle complexity, massive calculation with high accuracy
    - weakness could be inherent bias by the available data, or by its creator

## Data
  - The internet age --> massive personal data available (even after anonymise, which is really hard)
  - Data help predict trends: **improve service quality**, but also allow for **manipulation**, **discrimination**
    - Law is still playing catch up with reality
    
## Justice
  - Human judge can't make consistent judgement: probably because of subjective, mood, environmental factors, etc.
    - Machine is more consistent
  - Machine can fall into mathematical bias: same accuracy rate may result in more cases of false positive
    - Example: 75% accuracy in population of 100 and 200, will result in 25 and 50 cases of false positve
  - Propose: maybe a system to combined human + machine, such that each strength complement each other weakness, for a target goal
  
## Medicine
  - Pathology: human is good at distinguish cancer, but machine is better at detect abnormality
    - Combine machine at detect abnormality, and pathologist at investigate that abnormality for cancer --> largest improvement
  - Other medical diagnosis is much harder, to correctly identify the diagnosis, or consistently label them
    - Example: breast cancer tumor may not need treatment, but we don't know how to distinguish them yet
    - How to "encode" symptoms in a machine-readable format
  - Data linkage: give doctors a clearer patient history --> better & correct treatment
    - Privacy problem: individual health records may be used different to originally intent
    
## Cars
  - Driverless car future quickly becomes a reality
  - Driving algorithm has to operate with a lot of uncertainty: varied road condition, uncertain object identification --> conflict sensors inputs
  - Ethical problem: when accident is unavoidable, who to save & who to sacrifice
    - People may choose the high ground in theoretical situations, but be selfish when they themselves have to decide
  - Full-automated which revert to human driver when necessary: may reduce driver ability to react correctly, when their override is actually needed
    - Example: Air France Flight 447: the pilot inadvertedly stalled the aircraft, causing it to fall & crash later after the autopilot was dis-engaged becaused of sensors being iced-over
  - Propose: what about driver-assisted
