# Emergent trends
  - Three main trend: 
    + Big Data and Real-Time Analytics: let user monitor trends (sales, markets, etc) in real time and quickly respond to demands
    + Cloud-based migration: optimise operation, increase integration while reduce upfront cost, but still have access to latest tools
    + Apply AI: assist in analysis/decision making, using natural language

## Trends in areas
  - **AI & Advanced Analytics**
    + AI-powered demand forecasting & sensing --> improve accuracy, optimise inventory
    + Predictive maintenance --> reduce downtime
    + Sentiment analysis & market/weather/political risk management with early warnings & mitigation
    + Autonomous operations: self-driving vehicles, drones, robotics
  - **Real-Time Data & Integration**
    + IoT for real-time tracking across the supply chain
    + Data lakes & data virtualisation: combine raw data from multiple sources into one repository for comprehensive analysis
    + Real-time streaming & Complex Event Processing (CEP) --> react to events quickly
    + BI dashboards for real-time insights & pattern identification
  - **Cloud & Collaboration**
    + Cloud-based platforms for real-time data sharing & integration across partners
    + Collaborative forecasting between production & retail partners --> shared visibility
    + Omni-channel management to unify demand signals across sales channels
  - **Distribution & Logistics**
    + Smart warehousing with robotics & optimised layouts
    + Last-mile delivery optimization & drone delivery
    + Route optimization
  - **Planning & Risk**
    + Resource forecasting & allocation using advanced software
    + Scenario modeling for risk management
    + Data-driven planning with federated querying across sources
  - **Sustainability**
    + Green logistics practices to reduce environmental impact
    + Blockchain for supply chain transparency & traceability

# Supply chain software & technology

## Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
 - Benefits:
   + Automates manual process --> faster & more accurate
   + Real-time visibility --> Data-driven decision making ==> easier decision-making
   + Improve control --> reduce cost (e.g. excess stock, miss stock), yet improve quality of service (e.g. accurate order fulfillment, real-time order update)
 - ERP master data
   + Bill of material (BOM): a list of components & materials + quantity required to manufacture a product
   + Product catalog: name, description, pricing and unit of measurement (e.g. each or box of 5)
   + Inventory policies: Re-rder point (e.g. the stock amount that would trigger re-order) & safety stock level (e.g. the amount of buffer against unexpected demand spikes or supply disruption)
   + Data maintenance: Update data regularly as its change (e.g. update status of discontinued products)
 - Review inventory availability: to prevent stockouts, ensure timely reorders yet optimise our storage space
   + Check current stock level, re-order the appropriate amount, from selected supplier, with instruction for expected delivery date
   + Could create replenish schedule, or re-order trigger based on current inventory + forecast demand

## Planning tools
 - Benefits:
   + Optimise inventory level
   + Efficient allocation of resources
   + Optimise costs (transport, production & inventory costs)
   + Real-time visibility
 - Integrate with other system (e.g. ERP - enterprice resource planning, WMS - Warehouse Management, TMS - Transport) --> better overal decision making as more & better, more comprehensive data are available, at almost real-time
 - Scenario planning:
   + Data collection & validation: using tools to automate the validation process
   + Demand planning: tools supplied various forecasting models & algorithms
   + Production planning --> simulate different production scenario
   + Inventory planning --> optimize inventory levels based on demand forecast & production plans; consider factors such as service level targets, lead times, demand variability & costs.
   + Distribution planning --> optimize the distribution network
 - Plan will change --> need review & adjustments, especially with new info/feedbacks. Also need monitoring & control
