# AI-900: Artificial Intelligence Workloads and Considerations
  - URL: "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/ai-900"

## Exam categories
  - AI workloads & consideration (15-20%)
  - Principle of ML on Azure (20-25%)
  - Features of computer vision workloads on Azure (15-20%)
  - Features of NLP workloads on Azure (15-20%)
  - Features of generative AI workloads on Azure

## Overview
  - AI: copies the behavior & actions of human
  - AI usage: prediction, anormality detection, knowledge mining
    + Computer vision: process image & video --> detect object, recognise face, extract text from image
    + Natural Language Processing: understand written/spoken langauge --> analyzes & interprets text --> automatically translates spoken/written language
    + Generative AI: create original content such as text, images, and code

### AI usage examples
  - Machine learning: 
    + prediction --> focast business demand
    + classifying risk for bank, insurance
  - Knowledge mining: ingest documents (unstructured documents) --> text recognition to pull out key phrases & words --> publish to a searchable library/database
  - Anormality detection: fraudulent credit card usage, machine sensors
  - Computer vision: facial recognition & analysis, text in image
  - Natural language processing: speech recognition & synthesis, translation, text analytics --> positive/negative
  - Content moderation: analyze text & image for "censored/protected" contents (i.e. violence, sexual, copyrighted, etc. )
  - Personalization: recommendation in e-commerce/social network 
  - Generative AI: answer in natural language, create images from description, create codes

### Reponsible AI
  1. Fairness: should treat all people fairely --> limit bias in algorigthm, data
  2. Reliability & safety: testing --> handle errors and resist manipulation
  3. Privacy & security: protect user data
  4. Inclusiveness: all users can be used by all people
  5. Transparency: user should aware of how the system work and the limitations --> documentations ?
  6. Accountability: should follow governance & frameworks
