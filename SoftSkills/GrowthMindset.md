# Growth mindset

## Growth mindset course
  - From coursera: https://www.coursera.org/learn/growth-mindset/home/welcome
  - Fixed vs. growth mindset: 
    + Fixed: your skills & abilities are fixed and can't be developed
    + Growth: you can improves your skills & abilities over times with practice & intention
  - Mindset can change in different settings (i.e. per projects, with different people, etc.)
  - Organisation can also have fixed vs. growth mindset
  - Science believes that we could "train" our brain into new thinking (i.e. [neuroplasticity video by Sentis](https://youtu.be/ELpfYCZa87g?si=MfkCGoNfpyYOmc4f))

### Reframing Fixed Mindsets
  - The "not yet" mind-frame: frame skill lacking as not-yet achieved
  - Deliberate facing challenge, learn new skills --> go out of comfort zone to "growth your brain"
  - Identify circumstances of fixed mind-set --> deliberate practice growth mindset
  - Pit-falls of growth mindset:
    + Improvement is limitless: each person have their own growth ceiling where the improvement is not justifiable for the efforts
    + Growth is not the same as overwork
    + Good effort is not enough without satisfied outcomes: could fail while trying new approach

### Comparing
  - Fixed mindset: more judgemental --> seeing other success as thread
    + Comparison trap: afraid of failure --> further avoid tasks that have failed before
    + Growth mindset: see other success as inspiration

### Organisation
  - Fixed mindset organisation: hire people with "required" ability, not expecting further growth
  - Growth mindset: encourage innovation, empower employee to take risk & growth
  - Leadership for growth mindset: willing to mentor team member (i.e. retell past mistake, constructive critisim), seeking feedback from team member
  - Positive quotient: Optimistic vs. Pessimistic vs. Defensive Pessimistic
    + Defensive Pessimistic: (1) agree of the goal, but slow down to (2) prepare for possible mishap 
      - Maybe mistake for Pessimistic 
      - Alternative approach: confirm your commitment to the goal (1), before explore possible mishaps & contigency plans
  - Avoid "**Group thinking**": noone want to challenge the group process
    + Ask for anonymous feedback
    + Dedicate someone to act as "devil advocate"
    + Explicitly let team member voice their concerns about change that they're nervous about

### Giving and Receiving feedback
  - Failures/negative feedback:
    + Fixed-mindset: perceive as permanent stigma, label --> always torment his/herself about it
    + Growth-mindset: after some self-pity time, would attempt to learn/growth from it
  - Giving feedback: Focus on (1) **efforts**, (2) **strategies** and (3) **outcomes**

### Notes
  - Mindset is not permanent, but may change by situations
  - Growth mindset --> Need constant practice
