# Large Language Model

## Basic principles of prompts
Think of it as a conversation:
  1. Start with some context
  1. Direct & clear instructions
    - May give it a role to play --> improve context & clarify instructions
  1. Chain prompts: break complex request into sequence of request
    - May improve accuracy --> overcome limits on # tokens per returned value
  1. Provide example one/few == one/few shot prompting
  1. Using XML

## Misc.
  - AI: can do a lot already, limit only by our imagination

### How AI interprets your message
  - AI is trained on human-to-human language --> expected to be spoken to like a person

### Strategize to work with AI
  - Structure prompts clearly RTFD:
    + Role: assign AI a role
    + Task: clearly define the task
    + Format: the structure of the response
    + Details: tones, audience, etc. (i.e. context)
  - AI won't ask for clarification
    + will work on what provided --> may give in-accurate response
    + So, if response is not what expected --> clarify
  - Can use AI to improve your own prompts
  - Break complex tasks into smaller steps
  - Test ideas side by side
  - Avoid making AI only tell you what you want to hear:
    + Ask for opinion vs. telling it what to do
    + Ask it to play devil's advocate --> challenge your opinions (objective or pragmatic)
  - May ask AI to improve its own result --> provide more context, direction

### Avoid pitfalls
  - Don't just accept the first answer
  - Make your own judgment
  - Don't treat it like a search engine
  - Don't ignore your own experise
  - Don't assume AI reads between the line

### Fact checking techniques
  - Ask for reference & check it: AI may "fake" it
  - Use a different AI engine to cross-check

## Creative ways to leverage AI
  - Simulate team discussion --> explore pros & cons of a design
    + Some new platforms allow multiple isolated AI to work together --> each represent a different viewpoint
  - Discuss with AI as a colleague --> brainstorm
