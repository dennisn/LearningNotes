# Hello World: How to be human in the age of the machine

## 1. Power

Discuss the power balance between entrusting too much, or too little to the machine --> know what to trust/delegate and what not

  - People have a tendency to **overlook** the capability of **machine making mistake** !
    - *Is a program really smart, or just an excel sheet wrapped in code?*
  - Yet once an error is found, we become distrust of the machine capability, even though it is better than us in many **right** situations
  - AI, or algorith, is designed set of instructions --> hence it has strength & weakness, as decided by its designer
    - strength often be the ability to handle complexity, massive calculation with high accuracy
    - weakness could be inherent bias by the available data, or by its creator

## 2. Data
  - The internet age --> massive personal data available (even after anonymise, which is really hard)
  - Data help predict trends: **improve service quality**, but also allow for **manipulation**, **discrimination**
    - Law is still playing catch up with reality
    
## 3. Justice
  - Human judge can't make consistent judgement: probably because of subjective, mood, environmental factors, etc.
    - Machine is more consistent
  - Machine can fall into mathematical bias: same accuracy rate may result in more cases of false positive
    - Example: 75% accuracy in population of 100 and 200, will result in 25 and 50 cases of false positve
  - Propose: maybe a system to combined human + machine, such that each strength complement each other weakness, for a target goal
  
## 4. Medicine
  - Pathology: human is good at distinguish cancer, but machine is better at detect abnormality
    - Combine machine at detect abnormality, and pathologist at investigate that abnormality for cancer --> largest improvement
  - Other medical diagnosis is much harder, to correctly identify the diagnosis, or consistently label them
    - Example: breast cancer tumor may not need treatment, but we don't know how to distinguish them yet
    - How to "encode" symptoms in a machine-readable format
  - Data linkage: give doctors a clearer patient history --> better & correct treatment
    - Privacy problem: individual health records may be used different to originally intent
    
## 5. Cars
  - Driverless car future quickly becomes a reality
  - Driving algorithm has to operate with a lot of uncertainty: varied road condition, uncertain object identification --> conflict sensors inputs
  - Ethical problem: when accident is unavoidable, who to save & who to sacrifice
    - People may choose the high ground in theoretical situations, but be selfish when they themselves have to decide
  - Full-automated which revert to human driver when necessary: may reduce driver ability to react correctly, when their override is actually needed
    - Example: Air France Flight 447: the pilot inadvertedly stalled the aircraft, causing it to fall & crash later after the autopilot was dis-engaged becaused of sensors being iced-over
  - Propose: what about driver-assisted
  
## 6. Crimes
  - Various examples of using computer: pattern matching, data analysis, etc. to combat crime
  - In practice, can result in various unexpected outcomes:
    - Increase police present in hotspots: cause pressure on legitimate citizen, also will catch more actual crimes --> artificially feed back into predicting algo. marking that area as a hotspot
	- Mis-identification: facial recognition algo. could be fooled
  - Still, we can't ignore the fact that machine can significantly help in crime-fighting
  - The need for a balance between where/when machine is used vs. human, 

## 7. Art
  - It's hard to determine good vs. bad art, be it music, movie or painting
    - Make it even harder for machine to create good art piece, when we can't define what is "good"
  - Instead of create from scratch, some program tries to simulate well-known artists --> not really creative works

## 8. Conclusion
  - Machine may be very good at certain thing, but they also have extreme weakness that make their work not "right"
    - They depend on us for input & training data --> chance for mistake, bias
	- Their algorithm may have built-in bias via the methodology being used
  - Machine does greatly improve our performance
==> Maybe a better approach is to build machines that "assists" us instead of working alone. 
Also needs built-in error correction, since the machine will **definitely** produce incorrect result from time to time
