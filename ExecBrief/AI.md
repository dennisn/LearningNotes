# Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence

## Machine Learning
  - Traditional computer program: good at discrete result (e.g. yes/no, good/bad, etc.)
  - Machine learning: widen computer ability to predict the probability of some result in the future !
  - ML definition: 
    - Learn from existing sample data 
    - To build a model that can be used to predict future result base on actual data at that time
  - ML algorithms: mutliple algorithms hosted on ML platform, each with its own pros & cons and suitability
    - Which model to use: decided by the data scientists through an iterative process
    - Result: the probability of some result, a number, but no explanation (i.e. "**Blackbox of ML**")
  - ML algorithm types:
    - Supervised learning: 
      - Classification: binary-classification vs. multi-class classification
        - Example binary: Spam or no spam email.
        - Example multi-class: Animal types
      - Regression: result is a single value 
        - Example: expected house price
    - Un-supervised learning: don't provide the same level of direction/intention as above
	  - Clustering: understand the structure of the data by grouping them together
	  - Abnormally detection

## AI & Generative AI
  - Artificial Intelligence: hard to defined as we keep expands the requirements
  - Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): strong/full AI
    - In theory (not practical yet), an AI that could **understand, learn and/or perform** any mental/intellectual task a human can do
  - Narrow/Weak AI: performs one specific task (can often outperform a human)
  - Current generation of AI (e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, etc): can perform a wider range of task, but still not full AGI yet, as it still need direct prompts, and not capable of reasoning or independent decision-making
