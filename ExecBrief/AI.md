# Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence

## Machine Learning
  - Traditional computer program: good at discrete result (e.g. yes/no, good/bad, etc.)
  - Machine learning: widen computer ability to predict the probability of some result in the future !
    - ML: starts from sample data vs. traditional program: start from the rule
  - ML definition: 
    - Learn from existing sample data 
    - To build a model that can be used to predict future result base on actual data at that time
  - ML algorithms: mutliple algorithms hosted on ML platform, each with its own pros & cons and suitability
    - Which model to use: decided by the data scientists through an iterative process
    - Result: the probability of some result, a number, but no explanation (i.e. "**Blackbox of ML**")
  - ML algorithm types:
    - Supervised learning: 
      - Classification: binary-classification vs. multi-class classification
        - Example binary: Spam or no spam email.
        - Example multi-class: Animal types
      - Regression: result is a single value 
        - Example: expected house price
    - Un-supervised learning: don't provide the same level of direction/intention as above
	  - Clustering: understand the structure of the data by grouping them together
	  - Abnormally detection

## AI & Generative AI
  - Artificial Intelligence: hard to defined as we keep expands the requirements
    - AI vs. ML: ML is a subset of methods creating AI (i.e. there are other AI methods that are not ML)
  - Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): strong/full AI
    - In theory (not practical yet), an AI that could **understand, learn and/or perform** any mental/intellectual task a human can do
  - Narrow/Weak AI: performs one specific task (can often outperform a human)
  - Current generation of AI (e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, etc): can perform a wider range of task, but still not full AGI yet, as it still need direct prompts, and not capable of reasoning or independent decision-making
  - Deep learning & Neural Networks:
    - Pros: better results in complex situation
	- Cons: expensive & demanding (e.g. lots of data and lots of processing)
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP): Not just about "understand" the speaking/writting sentence
    - Understand the context (e.g. where, when, what, etc)
	- Retrieve the relevant info.
	- Determine the correct respond
	- Construct a natural language respond
  - Generative AI: capable of creating new and "original" content with "prompt"
    - Prompt Engineering: plan/formulate and create effective "prompts" to guide the behavior/output of generative AI
    - Foundation Model: AI trained on huge amounts of data, then adapt to mutliple usages
      - Include text-based Large-Language Model, image-based or video-based generative AI
      - Large Language Model (LLM): AI trained on vast amounts of text data, so to interact with, and generate, human language
  - AI hallucinations: genAI create convincing results but are wrong
    - Because at its root, genAI still mix & match existing sample, without actually understand it
	- Example: auto-complete would suggest most likely words based on statistical likelihood, not on the actual message context
